# pytorch-weighted-sampler

This repo explores using [WeightedRandomSampler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.WeightedRandomSampler) provided by Pytorch to perform undersampling/oversampling.

There has been many questions online regarding this issue, and I personally was not able to get a satisfactory answer. ([ex1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67799246/weighted-random-sampler-oversample-or-undersample) [ex2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60320232/pytorch-how-to-undersample-using-weightedrandomsampler))

I created this repo to test on a very simple toy example to see how exactly this could be achieved.
